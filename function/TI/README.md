# Postgres SQL Functions for Tilia

These functions are designed to interact with the Tilia software package, written and developed by Eric Grimm.  
SQL functions were developed and implemented by [Steve Crawford](https://www.ems.psu.edu/directory/stephen-crawford) as part of the process of migrating the Neotoma Paleoecological Database from a SQL Server database to a Postgres database.
