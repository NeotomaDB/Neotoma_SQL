# Adding Uncertainty to Neotoma

The use of uncertainty is critical. We need it directly associated with individual measurements, and we need to identify the type of uncertainty.

## Table modifications

The table `ndb.data` needs two new columns: `uncertaintyvalue` and `uncertaintytype`.

They will inherit information from the `ndb.variables` row, so the assumption is that the uncertainty is reported in the same units (and for the same taxon) as the `ndb.data.value`.

### Proposed `ndb.data` structure:

| dataid | sampleid | variableid | value | uncertaintyvalue | uncertaintybasisid | . . . |

### Proposed `ndb.uncertaintybasis` structure:

| uncertaintybasisid | uncertaintybasis | . . . |

#### Proposed `ndb.uncertaintybasis.uncertaintybasis` values:

Proposed values for uncertainty tables will come from standard reporting of uncertainty.

* 1 Standard Deviation
* 2 Standard Deviations
* 3 Standard Deviations
* Mean square error
